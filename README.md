A easy to use and super quick way to organize your inventory, storage and storage areas.

### Note
At the moment sqStorage is only available in German, a translation to English is work in progress and to be come.

### Installation
In order for sqStorage to work, the database structure (file) **tlv_empty.sql** has to be imported, for example using *phpmyadmin*.
The directories **smartyfiles/** and **languages/locale/** need to be writeable for the webserver.
**chown -R www-data smartyfiles/** and **chown -R www-data languages/locale/** should do it in most cases.

### Configuration
By default, the database name used is *tlv* and the main user *tlvUser* with the password *tlvUser* - this can be configured in **support/dba.php** changing the ***DB::dbName***,  ***DB::$user*** and ***DB::$password*** variables.
